In comparison the authors cropped a 512x512 section from the image around the center and divide it into 32x32 blocks with a pixel size of 16x16 each. Like the authors i then calculate the densty of black pixels and qunatizise this into 10 levels, which are represented by the ASCII numbers of 0-9. Each number represents a block resulting in a string with 35 lines, where each line has 35 numbers. A low density equals 0 and the higher the density of black pixels becomes the closer to 9 it will be. "
