Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000004000000000000\n00000000000000000021200000000000\n00000000000000000020200000000000\n00000000000000000322242222222222\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000031112200000000000000\n00000000000300000120000000000000\n00000000003000000134210000000000\n00000000002000000202020000000000\n00000000002000000202020000000000\n00000000002000000202020000000000\n00000000003000000224220000000000\n00000000001100000030000000000000\n00000000000110000300000000000000\n00000000000012222000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000001223000000000000000\n00000000000031000210000000000000\n00000000000120000144210000000000\n00000000000300000202020000000000\n00000000000200000202020000000000\n00000000000300000202020000000000\n00000000000200000324220000000000\n00000000000030000030000000000000\n00000000000013322200000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000400000000000000\n00000000000000002430000000000000\n00000000000000024243000000000000\n00000000000000442424500000000000\n00000000000000043224000000000000\n00000000000000004440000000000000\n00000000000000000500000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000004000000000000\n00000000000000000021200000000000\n00000000000000000020200000000000\n00000000000000000323560000000000\n00000000000000000002003000000000\n00000000000000000003220000000000\n00000000000000000000010000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000073220000000000\n00000000000000000434012000000000\n00000000000000001401102000000000\n00000000000000003300302000000000\n00000000000000000354220000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000050000000000000\n00000000000000000324222222222222\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000001323320000000000000\n00000000000031000003000000000000\n00000000000300000002100000000000\n00000000000300000000300000000000\n00000000000200000000200000000000\n00000000001100000000300000000000\n00000000000300000000300000000000\n00000000000110000000200000000000\n00000000000030000023002222000000\n00000000000002332300030000200000\n00000000000000000000300000020000\n00000000000233100003000000003000\n00000000032000230002000000002000\n00000000200000003002000000002000\n00000000300000002002000000002000\n00000003000000000203000000003000\n00000002000000000300300000031000\n00000001100000000300030000310000\n00000000300000003000002222100000\n00000000210000002000000000000000\n00000000013102330000000000000000\n00000000000220000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000322230000000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000000324340000000000\n00000000000000000011011000000000\n00000000000000000030003000000000\n00000000000000000003130000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000001310000000000000\n00000000000000013012000000000000\n00000000000000030003000021000000\n00000000000000020003001302300000\n00000000000000003353341000021000\n00000000000000000000030000003000\n00000000000000000000030000003000\n00000000000000000000030000002000\n00000000000000000000041000021000\n00000000000000000000031301300000\n00000000000000000000030021000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000322230000000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000002222533342222222222\n00000000000003000200000000000000\n00000000000002000020000000000000\n00000000000030000030000000000000\n00000000000021000030000000000000\n00000000000001302200000000000000\n00000000000000031000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000033300000000000\n00000000000000003200023000000000\n00000000000000020000000200000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000030122200300000000\n00000000000000023100121200000000\n00000000000000004000023000000000\n00000000000000002322250000000000\n00000000000000000311300000000000\n00000000000000000011000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000030000000000000\n00000000000000000305000000000000\n00000000000000000445000000000000\n00000000000000000344000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000323000000000000\n00000000000000002000320000000000\n00000000000000002101420000000000\n00000000000000000324430000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000001310000000000000\n00000000000000013012000000000000\n00000000000000030003000000000000\n00000000000000020003000000000000\n00000000000000003330000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000030013322310000\n00000000000000000303130000013000\n00000000000000000202400000000300\n00000000000000000324000000000300\n00000000000000000002000000000020\n00000000000000000002000000000030\n00000000000000000002000000000020\n00000000000000000003000000000200\n00000000000000000002300000000300\n00000000000000000002020000003100\n00000000000000000002013321320000\n00000000000000000002000001000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000033300000000000\n00000000000000003200023000000000\n00000000000000020000000200000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000030000022421000000\n00000000000000030000020302000000\n00000000000000021000021202000000\n00000000000000003000023002000000\n00000000000000000322252222000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000002000002000\n00022220000000000000003000003000\n00200002000000000000002200022000\n00300003000000000000000031300000\n00200002000000000000000002000000\n01300003100000000000000000000000\n00030030000000000000000000000000\n00002300000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000001\n11110000000000000000000000000000\n11121000000000000000000000000000\n00003000000000000000000000000000\n00003000000000000000000000000000\n00003000000000000000000000000000\n20022000000000000000000000000000\n13300000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000032223000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000003223532230000000000\n00000000000030003031003000000000\n00000000000400130003100400000000\n00000000005211443234411150000000\n00000000032001622153510023000000\n00000000301002525613222020300000\n00000000202252603304656220100000\n00000000203523432433002531100000\n00000000330370235762354302200000\n00000000500326337975362300400000\n00000000420336335863006401300000\n00000000212422034433333511100000\n00000000202465632330724330100000\n00000000301021240550512020300000\n00000000131001526232630022100000\n00000000015000254235300051000000\n00000000001522320002322510000000\n00000000000130012022002100000000\n00000000000013113541131000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000122210000000000\n00000000000000000200020000000000\n00000000000000000200020000000000\n00000000000000000200020000000000\n00000000000000000322232222222223\n00000000000000000000000000000005\n00000000000000000000000000000014\n00000000000000000000000000000033\n00000000000000000000000000000021\n00000000000000000000000000000020\n00000000000000000000000000000020\n00000000000000000000000000000030\n00000000000000000000000000000003\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000002000000000\n00000000000000000000003000000000\n00000000000000000000002000000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n21000000000000000000030000000000\n01200000000000000000020000000000\n00030000000000000000200000000000\n00002200000000000000300000000000\n00000130000000000000200000000000\n00000003100000000002000000000000\n00000000220000000003000000000000\n00000000003000013302000000000000\n00000000000210030050000000000000\n00000000000013020033230000000000\n00000000000003440260002000000000\n00000000000030035230012000000000\n00000000000020021624242222222222\n00000000000022154223320000000000\n00000000000000421440030000000000\n00000000000003300230030000000000\n00000000000130300333310000000000\n00000000003100023002000000000000\n00000000030000000003000000000000\n00000002200000000002000000000000\n00000031000000000000200000000000\n00001300000000000000300000000000\n00022000000000000000200000000000\n00300000000000000000020000000000\n22000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000002000000000\n00000000000000000000003000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000232000000000000\n00000000000000003000300000000000\n00000000000000003023400000000000\n00000000000000003210420000000000\n00000000000000000523030000000000\n00000000000000000200020000000000\n00000000000000000023200000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000003001300000000\n00000000000000002320544023200000\n00000000000000030003000300030000\n00000000000000110020000110020000\n00000000000000300030000030003000\n00000000000001100200000011002000\n00000000000000200110000020003000\n00000000000000200020000020002000\n00000000000000300030000030003000\n00000000000000120021000210021000\n00000000000000013001203100300000\n00000000000000000322353223000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000023310000000000000\n00000000000000032230000000000000\n00000000000000030260000000000000\n00000000000000021310000000000000\n00000000000000022000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000100000000000000\n00000000000000035143100000000000\n00000000000000331423210000000000\n00000000000003350305330000000000\n00000000000005105641050000000000\n00000000000020437973503000000000\n00000000000004105850141000000000\n00000000000004350305340000000000\n00000000000001130503120000000000\n00000000000000245044200000000000\n00000000000000001310000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000001100000000000000\n00000000000000032130000000000000\n00000000000002533312200000000000\n00000000000003000030300000000000\n00000000000003000120300000000000\n00000000000002000000300000000000\n00000000000002100001300000000000\n00000000000000130032000000000000\n00000000000000002300000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000200000000000000000000000\n00000000200000000000000000000000\n00000000030000000000000000000000\n00000000021000000000000000000000\n00000000003000000000000000000000\n00000000001200000000000000000000\n00000000000300000000000000000000\n00000000000030000000000000000000\n00000000000020000000000000000000\n00000000000003000000000000000000\n00000000000001100000000000000000\n00000000000000300000000000000000\n00000000000000020000000000000000\n00000000000000050004000000000000\n00000000000000213021200000000000\n00000000000000302120200000000000\n00000000000002222722242222222222\n00000000000000001320000000000000\n00000000000000003030000000000000\n00000000000000022123000000000000\n00000000000000030000000000000000\n00000000000000300000000000000000\n00000000000000200000000000000000\n00000000000003000000000000000000\n00000000000011000000000000000000\n00000000000030000000000000000000\n00000000000200000000000000000000\n00000000000200000000000000000000\n00000000003000000000000000000000\n00000000012000000000000000000000\n00000000030000000000000000000000\n00023200210000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000013100000000000\n00000000000000000120220000000000\n00000000000000000322030000000000\n00000000000000000402030000000000\n00000000000000000254300000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000010000000000000\n00000000000000023223000000000000\n00000000000001433321520000000000\n00000000000012201362140000000000\n00000000000030645343033000000000\n00000000000033236454220200000000\n00000000000041243635441100000000\n00000000000060156336233000000000\n00000000000033643653024000000000\n00000000000011223252351000000000\n00000000000003030042110000000000\n00000000000000235532300000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000002000000000000001100\n00000000000000200000000000000412\n00000000000000300000000000002132\n00000000000000300000000000012001\n01000000000000200000000000030000\n03000000000000110000000000300000\n41000000000000030000000003000000\n40000000000000030000000021000000\n41000000000000030000000120000000\n01320000000000020000000300000000\n00003200000000002000003000000000\n00000032000000003000030000000000\n00000000330000003000210000000000\n00000000002300002001200000000000\n00000000000023000203000000000000\n00000000000000230330000000000000\n00000000000000003822222222222222\n00000000000000032330000000000000\n00000000000013200212000000000000\n00000000001310002002100000000000\n00000000131000003000300000000000\n00000023100000003000030000000000\n00002310000000002000003000000000\n00230000000000011000001200000000\n33000000000000030000000210000000\n30000000000000030000000030000000\n20000000000000030000000003000000\n00000000000000020000000000300000\n00000000000000200000000000120000\n00000000000000300000000000021000\n00000000000000300000000000003000\n00000000000000200000000000000533\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000111110000000000\n00000000000000000300030000000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000024221002100000000\n00000000000000040002000300000000\n00000000000000023002003000000000\n00000000000000022102012000000000\n00000000000000022423230000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000200000000000000\n00000000000000000200000000000132\n00120000000000000200000000000303\n00314000000000000200000000000051\n00331300000000000200000000000310\n00000030000000000200000000003100\n00000003000000000200000000031000\n00000000300000000200000000310000\n00000000030000000200000003100000\n00000000003000000200000031000000\n00000000000300000200000200000000\n00000000000030000200002000000000\n00000000000003000200020000000000\n00000000000000300200300000000000\n00000000000000030203000000000000\n00000000000000003230000000000000\n22222222222222222832222222222222\n00000000000000003330000000000000\n00000000000000030203000000000000\n00000000000000300200300000000000\n00000000000003000200030000000000\n00000000000030000200003000000000\n00000000000300000200000300000000\n00000000003000000200000030000000\n00000000030000000200000003000000\n00000000300000000200000000300000\n00000003000000000200000000030000\n00000030000000000200000000003000\n00000300000000000200000000000303\n00004000000000000200000000000042\n00031300000000000200000000000003\n00023300000000000200000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000022000000000000000\n00000000000000120232000000000000\n00000000000000300002000000000000\n00000000000003000002000000000000\n00000000000001200053000000000000\n00000000000000210344000000000000\n00000000000000033310000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000130000000000\n00000000000000000023102320000000\n00000000000000000300000003000000\n00000000000000002100000002100000\n00000000000000003000000000300000\n00000000000000020000000000210000\n00000000000000003333100000200000\n00000000000000004000300000200000\n00000000000000023000030000300000\n00000000000000022200020002100000\n00000000000000003120300031000000\n00000000000000000335322300000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000004000000000000\n00000000000000000021200000000000\n00000000000000000020200000000000\n00000000000000000322230000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000012221000000000000\n00000000000000020312100000000000\n00000000000001352424310000000000\n00000000000003024243020000000000\n00000000000002552834430000000000\n00000000000002023333130000000000\n00000000000002253425120000000000\n00000000000000120502200000000000\n00000000000000013222000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000233322200000000000\n00000000000002101310120000000000\n00000000000003002130020000000000\n00000000000003015252030000000000\n00000000000000330623300000000000\n00000000000000042012200000000000\n00000000000000030003000000000000\n00000000000000013232000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000111110000000000\n00000000000000000300030000000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000012000002100000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000002100012000000000\n00000000000000000323230000000000\n00000000000000000002020000000000\n00000000000000000002220000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000322230000000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000000324350000000000\n00000000000000000030003000000000\n00000000000000000020002000000000\n00000000000000000020002000000000\n00000000000000000020012000000000\n00000000000000000002220000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000002000000000000\n00000000000000000130310000000000\n00000000000000002200022000000000\n00000000000000003000003000000000\n00000000000000002000002000000000\n00000000000000000200020000000000\n00000000000000000322230000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000013440000000000000\n00000000000000033454000000000000\n00000000000000044954000000000000\n00000000000000045544000000000000\n00000000000000005442000000000000\n00000000000000001100000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000050000000000000\n00000000000000000323000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n00000000000000000000030000000000\n00000000000000000111130000000000\n00000000000000000300050000000000\n00000000000000003000033000000000\n00000000000000012000032100000000\n00000000000000030000030300000000\n00000000000000003023233000000000\n00000000000000002310152000000000\n00000000000000000522250000000000\n00000000000000000200020000000000\n00000000000000000023200000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000012233322230000000000\n00000000000120003220003000000000\n00000000000300030043000300000000\n00000000003014530303533350000000\n00000000025341514105110023000000\n00000000123030226333233220200000\n00000000302021215334500130110000\n00000002003335350503532330020000\n00000003003542534653304350020000\n00000002004022426962263303110000\n00000000223003334743442302400000\n00000000330236413242330023400000\n00000000231033053254443150300000\n00000000111445207231503400300000\n00000000030051024330324101100000\n00000000030014223320303003000000\n00000000003103002545102230000000\n00000000000133431000153100000000\n00000000000000230001320000000000\n00000000000000002331000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000300000000000000\n00000000000000003030000000000000\n00000000000000002320000000000000\n00000000000000310001310000000000\n00000000000003030003030000000000\n00000000000001320001310000000000\n00000000000000001310000000000000\n00000000000000003030000000000000\n00000000000000001310000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000020000000000\n00000000000000000001303000000000\n00000000000000000022000220000000\n00000000000000000030000030000000\n00000000000000000142000020000000\n00000000000000000204000300000000\n00000000000000000324222200000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000230000000000000\n00000000000000002213432221000000\n00000000000000004000220002000000\n00000000000000032000220002000000\n00000000000000015000320002000000\n00000000000000003423242222000000\n00000000000000000333000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000003230003230000000000\n00000000000011003020002000000000\n00000000000011003020012000000000\n00000000000002230003230000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000003230000000000000\n00000000000000021003000000000000\n00000000000000021002000000000000\n00000000000000003230000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000003000000000000\n00000000000000002320232000000000\n00000000000000030000000300000000\n00000000000000110000000110000000\n00000000000000300000000030000000\n00000000000001100000000011000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000200000000020000000\n00000000000000300000000030000000\n00000000000000120000000210000000\n00000000000000013000003100000000\n00000000000000000322243222222222\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000003\n00000000000000000000000000000020\n00000000000000000000000000000020\n00000000000000000000000000000002\n00000000000000000000000000000003\n00000000000000000000000000000002\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000132223000000\n00000000000000000001300000300000\n00000000222332000013000000030000\n00000013000001100020000000001000\n00000030000000300020000000001000\n00000020000000020020000000001000\n00000200000000040020000000001000\n00000300000000033003000000030000\n00000120000000112100300000300000\n00000030000000300422342223000000\n00000003000003201100000000000000\n00000000233320003000000000000000\n00000000000000024322300000000000\n00000000000000030000022000000000\n00000000000000300000002000000000\n00000000000000200000000200000000\n00000000000003000000000300000000\n00000000000001100000000300000000\n00000000000000300000000200000000\n00000000000000300000003000000000\n00000000000000131000011000000000\n00000000000000001323310000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000002000000000000000\n00000000000001351310000000000000\n00000000000003060110000000000000\n00000000000003353410000000000000\n00000000000000000030000000000000\n00000000000000000120000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000032000000000000\n00000000000001223403000000000000\n00000000000002030204300000000000\n00000000000002203220431000000000\n00000000000004133443103000000000\n00000000000004224952232000000000\n00000000000030024543040000000000\n00000000000023403230330000000000\n00000000000000441203020000000000\n00000000000000030343220000000000\n00000000000000023200000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000001310000000000000\n00000000000000013044200000000000\n00000000000000030203120000000000\n00000000000000020303020000000000\n00000000000000003530030000000000\n00000000000000000133300000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000010000000000000\n00000000000000001212100000000000\n00000000000000003000200000000000\n00000000000000002000200000000000\n00000000000000003000300000000000\n00000000000000000323000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000100\n00000000000000000000000000000300\n00000000000000000000000000000020\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n01000000000000000000000000000000\n03000000000000000000000000000000\n31000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n30000000000000000000000000000000\n30000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000003200\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000133200000000000000000000\n00000000200200000000000000000000\n00000000200200100000000000000000\n00000000133200220000000000000000\n00000000000000030000000000000000\n00000000000000030000000000000000\n00000000000001310110000000000000\n00000000000000000012000000000000\n00000000000000000003000000000000\n00000000000000000003000000000000\n00000000000000000130000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000300002003000012000013000\n00000003000000202000030000000400\n00000003000000300200300000002400\n00000003000000300300200000012200\n00000001100000202000300000030110\n00000000300000122000200000300210\n00000000031000050000210003000200\n02323200002333230000012021003000\n52000031000000030000000452230000\n01320003000000020000000300000000\n00003202000000002000003000000221\n00000032300000003000030000002100\n00000000530000003000210000021000\n00000001102300002001200000020000\n00000003000023000203000000020000\n20000031000000230330000000020000\n03323300000000003822222222242222\n00000000000000032330000000003000\n00000000000013200212000000000300\n00002200001310002002100000000022\n00230023231000003000300000000000\n03000023300000003000030000000000\n11002310030000002000003001323330\n30230000020000011000001222000003\n53000000002000030000000320000000\n30000000020000030000000330000000\n20000000030000253210000203000000\n03000000020013120023000200300000\n02310003200120200002100300120000\n00013320000200300000300030021000\n00000000000300300000020002003012\n00000000000300200000200001233510\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",

Internally, fork_state saves the turtle state (is_down, x, y, heading), executes the block, then restores the original state.### Instruction:\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000001333100000000000\n00000000000000003000300000000000\n00000000000000020000030000000000\n00000000000000020000020000000000\n00000000000000003000300000000000\n00000000000000000323000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.\n### Response:\n",
