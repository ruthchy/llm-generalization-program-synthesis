Allows you to nest programs. Implementationally, embed gets the turtle state (is down, x, y, heading), executes program, then returns to the original state.\n<</SYS>>\n\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000003200000000000000\n00000000000000155446400000000000\n00000000000003544553420000000000\n00000000000007460406450000000000\n00000000000006405751354000000000\n00000000000023647064633000000000\n00000000000034405660442000000000\n00000000000016450405560000000000\n00000000000002453634450000000000\n00000000000000465346200000000000\n00000000000000011341000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.
