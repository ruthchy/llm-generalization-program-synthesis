Implementationally, embed gets the turtle state (is down, x, y, heading), executes program, then returns to the original state.\n<</SYS>>\n\nHere is a gray scale image represented with integer values 0-9:\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000001310000000000000\n00000000000000013012000000000000\n00000000000000030003000000000000\n00000000000000020003000000000000\n00000000000000003353000000000000\n00000000000000000303000000000000\n00000000000000000233000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000\nPlease write a Python program that generates this image using our custom turtle module.
